When the path is a directory, the behavior of fs.readFile() and fs.readFileSync() is platform-specific. On macOS, Linux, and Windows, an error will be returned. On FreeBSD, a representation of the directory's contents will be returned.The fs.readFile() function buffers the entire file. To minimize memory costs, when possible prefer streaming via fs.createReadStream().
